.SH "NAME"
scriptreplay \- play back typescripts, using timing information
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBscriptreplay\fP [options] \fItimingfile\fP [\fItypescript\fP [\fIdivisor\fP]]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This program replays a typescript, using timing information to ensure that output happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.
.sp
The replay simply displays the information again; the programs that were run when the typescript was being recorded are \fBnot run again\fP. Since the same information is simply being displayed, \fBscriptreplay\fP is only guaranteed to work properly if run on the same type of terminal the typescript was recorded on. Otherwise, any escape characters in the typescript may be interpreted differently by the terminal to which \fBscriptreplay\fP is sending its output.
.sp
The timing information is what \fBscript\fP(1) outputs to file specified by \fB\-\-log\-timing\fP.
.sp
By default, the \fItypescript\fP to display is assumed to be named \fBtypescript\fP,
but other filenames may be specified, as the second parameter or with option
\fB\-\-log\-out\fP.
.sp
If the third parameter or \fB\-\-divisor\fP is specified, it is used as a speed\-up multiplier. For example, a speed\-up of 2 makes \fBscriptreplay\fP go twice as fast, and a speed\-down of 0.1 makes it go ten times slower than the original session.
.sp
During the replay, you can interactively speed up, slow down, or pause the
playback using the Up, Down, and Space keys.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-I\fP, \fB\-\-log\-in\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
File containing \fBscript\fP\*(Aqs terminal input.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-O\fP, \fB\-\-log\-out\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
File containing \fBscript\fP\*(Aqs terminal output.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-B\fP, \fB\-\-log\-io\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
File containing \fBscript\fP\*(Aqs terminal output and input.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-timing\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
File containing \fBscript\fP\*(Aqs timing output.
This option replaces the \fItimingfile\fP positional argument.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-T\fP, \fB\-\-log\-timing\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
This is an alias for \fB\-t\fP, maintained for compatibility with \fBscript\fP(1) command\-line options.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-typescript\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
Deprecated alias of \fB\-\-log\-out\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-cr\-mode\fP \fImode\fP
.RS 4
Specifies how to handle the CR (carriage return, 0x0D) character from log
files. The default mode is \fBauto\fP, in which case CR is replaced with a
line break for the stdin log, because otherwise \fBscriptreplay\fP would
overwrite the same line. The other modes are \fBnever\fP and \fBalways\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-divisor\fP \fInumber\fP
.RS 4
Speed up the replay displaying this \fInumber\fP of times. The argument is a floating\-point number. It\(cqs called divisor because it divides the timings by this factor. This option overrides old\-style arguments.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-m\fP, \fB\-\-maxdelay\fP \fInumber\fP
.RS 4
Set the maximum delay between updates to \fInumber\fP of seconds. The argument is a floating\-point number. This can be used to avoid long pauses in the typescript replay.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-summary\fP
.RS 4
Display details about the session recorded in the specified timing file and
exit. The session must have been recorded using the \fBadvanced\fP format (see
\fBscript\fP(1) option \fB\-\-logging\-format\fP for more details).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-x\fP, \fB\-\-stream\fP \fItype\fP
.RS 4
Forces \fBscriptreplay\fP to print only the specified stream. The supported stream
types are \fBin\fP, \fBout\fP, \fBsignal\fP, and \fBinfo\fP. This option is recommended for
multi\-stream logs (created with \fB\-\-log\-io\fP) in order to print only the desired
data.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Display help text and exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
Display version and exit.

.SH "KEY BINDINGS"
.sp
The following keys control the playback of the script:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBSpace\fP: Toggles pause and unpause. Press this key to pause the playback, and press it again to resume.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBUp Arrow\fP: Increases the playback speed. Each press of this key will make the script replay faster by x0.1.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3

\fBDown Arrow\fP: Decreases the playback speed. Each press of this key will slow down the script replay by x0.1.
